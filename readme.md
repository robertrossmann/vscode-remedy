> A dark & bright theme with orange accents with roots in Base16 - Eighties colour theme

The theme features a orange accent throughout the UI. Code colours are based in the Base16 -
Eighties colours. My goal is to provide a very consistent colour coding for various tokens, so that
they look identical not just for a single language but also across all languages (ie. strings, type
annotations, classes, language keywords etc. have the same colour regardless of the language you
use). I believe I achieved that goal. üòç

## Installation

Go to the [Marketplace][marketplace-link] and install the theme from there. Alternatively, open the Extensions view in
VS Code and search for `@id:robertrossmann.remedy`.

## Language support

Most languages should provide reasonably well-defined colouring, though due to the TextMate grammars
not really using a standardised way of tokenising the code there might be slight deviations (ie.
some parts of code will have generic white-ish colour or language tokens will not be italicised).
The following languages have been manually tweaked to provide best experience:

- C / C++
- C#
- Go
- GraphQL
- HTML & CSS & Less
- Pug
- Java
- JavaScript & React
- TypeScript & React
- Svelte
- JSON
- Make
- Markdown
- PHP
- Shell
- SQL
- YAML
